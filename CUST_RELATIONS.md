# Customer Relations

As the owner of the marketplace, customers expect Accourage to facilitate transactions, provide fraud protections, and provide reliable access to the marketplace. As a middleman for a wide variety of transactions, customers expect some moderation of the services allowed on the marketplace, but want to retain their personal freedom to buy or sell non-traditional goods and services. 

## Fraud Protection
Customers expect a great deal of fraud protections. The escrow system put in place will prevent most of the basic fraud that takes place on normal marketplaces. More advanced fraud protection like requiring customers to provide a valid form of government ID can be implemented for high-risk transactions. 

## Provider-focused, user-protection
Provider-focused, user-protections demonstrates that Accourage is primarily interested in establishing high-quality providers, but also providing strong user protections. Due to the Provider-focus, It is important to take up little of the customer's attention, while still affording them a good experience. Customers and Providers expect Accourage to put the focus on the Providers, and it is in our best interest to do that. By focusing on Providers, customers are more likely to discover new goods or services to purchase. Accourage can provide marketing opportunities to reputable providers to improve outreach and sales.
