# Customer Service
Customer Service will be provided within our app. If users are having trouble with the app, they will be able to send questions or concerns using the in-app help feature. Customers with frequently asked questions may be automatically referred to the FAQs page. If this does not resolve the customer's issue, their question will be reviewed by our support team who will respond to the customer via an in-app message or via email.
# Feedback
Customers will also be able to give feedback about our app. This can be done through rating the app and posting comments in the app store, or by sending feedback in the app. Issues sent by customers will be considered by our development team.
# Complaints
Users will be able to make complaints about other users should they find it necessary. Our staff will review each complaint carefully and determine the proper action that must be taken when dealing with rude users.
