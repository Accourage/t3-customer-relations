# Customer Service

## How Customers Purchase
We have two type of customers, the ones offering a service and the ones buying a service. For the customers who are offering a service, they purchase from us by offering a delivery or a job, and when they are paid for that job, Accourage recieves a portion of that payment. The portion that Acourage takes is the purchase. For the customers buying a service, they purchase through the app by buying a delivery or job.
## How We Deliver Value
For delievery or job offering customers, we offer value by providing a platform to find customers. Our platform has value because it facilitates payments, draws customers in, and has multiple different avenues of ways to offer a service. For customers purchasing a job or delivery, we offer value by providing the platform for which the customer can purchase. Accourage is able to host multiple people willing to give a service.
