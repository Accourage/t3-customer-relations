# Customer Service
Customer Service will be provided within our app. If users are having trouble with the app, they will be able to send questions or concerns using the in-app help feature. Customers with frequently asked questions may be automatically referred to the FAQs page. If this does not resolve the customer's issue, their question will be reviewed by our support team who will respond to the customer via an in-app message or via email. By Promoting Online Support right in the application, customers can quickly find answers to their questions during the process of using the service or they can immediately send questions to our company for timely support.
## Feedback
Customers will also be able to give feedback about our app. This can be done through rating the app and posting comments in the app store, or by sending feedback in the app. Issues sent by customers will be considered by our development team.
## Complaints
Users will be able to make complaints about other users should they find it necessary. Our staff will review each complaint carefully and determine the proper action that must be taken when dealing with rude users. 
## How Customers Can Evaluate Our Offerings
Our app provides a large market of possible deliveries and jobs that can be requested by customers. On the app, customers can easily look through their options and evaluate which one they would prefer. We also have a system of evaluating people. After each job, the service provider and the customer can rate each other based on their performance.
## How Customers Purchase
We have two type of customers, the ones offering a service and the ones buying a service. For the customers who are offering a service, they purchase from us by offering a delivery or a job, and when they are paid for that job, Accourage recieves a portion of that payment. The portion that Acourage takes is the purchase. For the customers buying a service, they purchase through the app by buying a delivery or job.
## How We Deliver Value
For delievery or job offering customers, we offer value by providing a platform to find customers. Our platform has value because it facilitates payments, draws customers in, and has multiple different avenues of ways to offer a service. For customers purchasing a job or delivery, we offer value by providing the platform for which the customer can purchase. Accourage is able to host multiple people willing to give a service.
## Provider Programs
For well established providers, Accourage can provide scholarships for continued use of the platform. A donation program could also be established to reward providers that dotnate their services to the less fortunate.
